## 🌞 About the Game

Sun Chaser is an educational game that teaches players about the different speeds required to keep the sun fixed in the sky on each planet in our solar system. This concept, known as "chasing the terminator," demonstrates the different rotational speeds of planets.

## ✨ Features

- **Explore All Planets**: Play with all 8 planets in our solar system, each with scientifically accurate rotation speeds.
- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Choose between Easy, Normal, and Hard modes to adjust the challenge.
- **Educational Content**: Learn interesting facts about planetary rotation, including retrograde rotation on Venus and Uranus.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Click buttons or use arrow keys to increase speed and match the target speed.
- **Visual Feedback**: Watch the sun move across the horizon based on your speed.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Select a planet using the arrow buttons
2. Click "CHASE THE SUN!" to start
3. Rapidly click the RUN buttons or press arrow keys to increase your speed
4. Try to match the planet's rotation speed exactly to earn points
5. Keep the sun at the horizon for as long as possible
